In the floats html, i found that moving the divs around caused them to move below eachother or down another line. I was able to set the percentages
to 40 and 40 on the first 2 divs and have them both fit across one line. Then when I created the 3rd div they really were not fitting on one line so
I had to set the two side ones to 35 and the middle to 15 which made them into thinner colums that were able to fit on one line.

When working with the lists html, I was able to see how changing the list style reformatted the text box. Then adding in the red border
helped me see the actual size better since it was shaded. The padding then gave more space around the box which looks better.

When working with the positions html, it was really interesting to see how much the box would move around when I changed it to either left
or right and then moved more based on the pixels I added. Selecting the top instead aligned the box right up against the top of the other
section because it was set at 0px.
